# Collaborative Art Tool by Gilberto Guadiana

## Description
A collaborative art tool that aims to use NFT functionality to enhance collaboration.

## Instructions
Tools:
The bomb button is used to clear the canvas to a white background.

The anchor tool is used to draw fish hook looking objects on screen.

The pencil tool is used to draw streaks of circles on screen.
